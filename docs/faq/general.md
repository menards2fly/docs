### What is sideloading?

Sideloading is the process of installing apps on your iOS device outside of the official App Store, using developer certificates. This allows you to use apps that aren't available on the App Store or that have features Apple wouldn't normally approve.

### Is sideloading legal?

Yes, sideloading is legal. Apple provides developer certificates that allow installing apps for testing purposes. However, be mindful of copyright laws when sideloading apps that may infringe on intellectual property rights.

### Do I need to jailbreak my device to sideload apps?

No, sideloading does not require jailbreaking. It uses Apple's own developer mechanisms to install apps. This makes it a safer alternative to jailbreaking while still allowing you to install apps not available on the App Store.

### How long do sideloaded apps last?

Apps signed with developer certificates typically last for 1 year before needing to be resigned. However, if the certificate gets revoked by Apple, the apps will stop working before that time and will need to be reinstalled with a new certificate.

### What happens if my certificate gets revoked?

If your certificate is revoked, your sideloaded apps will stop working and show as "untrusted" when you try to open them. You'll need to reinstall them with a new valid certificate to continue using them.

### Can I sideload on any iOS version?

Yes, sideloading works on all iOS versions, but the specific methods and tools might vary depending on your iOS version. Newer iOS versions may require additional steps like enabling Developer Mode in your device settings.
