# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to our FAQ section! Here you'll find answers to the most common questions about our services.

## DxSign FAQs

For detailed information about DxSign certificates, refunds, entitlements, and troubleshooting, please visit our [DxSign FAQ page](/faq/dxsign.html).

### Refunds & Chargebacks

DxSign cannot and will not offer refunds due to how the registration process works when giving you a certificate. After a UDID is added, it cannot be removed for a year.

Please do not attempt to charge back your DxSign purchase with your bank or through PayPal. DxSign will immediately blacklist and revoke your certificate if this is attempted by any user.

### I recently made a purchase, and it's been 72 hours without receiving an email.

This means that Apple is taking longer to process your device, which is beyond our control. You will receive an email eventually, so please be patient. If it has been more than 4 days, we recommend creating a support ticket, and we will investigate the issue for you.

### My dashboard indicates that my device has been blacklisted.

This means your device is flagged by the Apple Developer Program and cannot be used or fully registered for a period of 14 to 30 days. Common reasons for this include signing up with a similar signing provider (e.g., Signulous). Devices can only be unblacklisted by re-registering them and waiting for the blacklist period to lift, which will make their UDID available for full registration again. Unfortunately, we cannot determine if your device is blacklisted until after 3 days of registration. You will receive an email regarding this issue and instructions on how to proceed.

### How does instant delivery work?

The first 10 devices registered under our accounts are processed instantly, and we filter purchases accordingly.

### How can I pay via other payment method?

Please create a support ticket in our Discord server, and we will check if we can accept your preferred payment method. We will provide you with a voucher that you can redeem on our website.

### How does revoke protection work?

If any of our accounts get revoked, we will transfer your existing device to another account that we own. If you didn't select this option, you'll need to make a new purchase.

## General Sideloading Questions

### What is sideloading?

Sideloading is the process of installing apps on your iOS device outside of the official App Store, using developer certificates.

### Is sideloading legal?

Yes, sideloading is legal. Apple provides developer certificates that allow installing apps for testing purposes. However, be mindful of copyright laws when sideloading apps.

### Do I need to jailbreak my device?

No, sideloading does not require jailbreaking. It uses Apple's own developer mechanisms to install apps.

### How long do sideloaded apps last?

Apps signed with developer certificates typically last for 1 year before needing to be resigned.

### What happens if my certificate gets revoked?

If your certificate is revoked, your sideloaded apps will stop working. You'll need to reinstall them with a new certificate.

### Can I sideload on any iOS version?

Yes, sideloading works on all iOS versions, but the specific methods and tools might vary depending on your iOS version.
